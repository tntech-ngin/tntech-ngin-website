Prof. Shannigrahi and Prof. Rogers have been awarded a National Science Foundation REU Grant to investigate the effects of an ScienceDMZ on a campus infrastructure.  [Link](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2019163)

ScienceDMZ networks are widely deployed in US academic campuses. However, there is a lack of studies around how ScienceDMZs influence actual scientific data and workflows. This supplemental project will design and perform a measurement study that will quantify the improvements brought forward by the new science DMZ. To achieve this, we are planning to deploy multiple measurement instruments at strategic points across the campus, ranging from PerfSonar nodes, docker containers with necessary software (iperf3, ping, traceroute, Wireshark etc), packet capture instruments (both optical taps and mirrored ports as required). The PIs will guide the undergraduate student(s) to perform the measurement experiments.
