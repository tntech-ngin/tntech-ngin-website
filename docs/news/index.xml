      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prof. Shannigrahi in collaboration with Colorado State University has been awarded a 
National Science Foundation Grant to investigate errors that happen in the Internet. 
This measurement and error detection/correction study will not only improve our 
understanding of Internet errors but also improve large data transfers over the 
Internet. &lt;a href=&#34;https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2019163&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
