      <description>Multiple Fully Funded Ph.D. Positions at the Next Generation Networking Lab
Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA
 We are looking for motivated students to work on several next-generation networking topics. The students will study, design, build, and deploy next-generation network infrastructure and protocols for various use cases such as Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality(AR/VR), Domain Science applications with Big Data (e.g., Climate Science, Genomics, Physics), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), 5G mobile networks, and more.</description>

      <description>Prof. Shannigrahi and Prof. Rogers have been awarded a National Science Foundation REU Grant to investigate the effects of an ScienceDMZ on a campus infrastructure. Link
ScienceDMZ networks are widely deployed in US academic campuses. However, there is a lack of studies around how ScienceDMZs influence actual scientific data and workflows. This supplemental project will design and perform a measurement study that will quantify the improvements brought forward by the new science DMZ.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prof. Shannigrahi and Prof. Rogers has received a $263K grant from National Science Foundation to create a Science DMZ at Tennessee Tech.
Created in collaboration with IT services, this project will enhance movement of large datasets to and from the campus. It will also
bring IPV6 deployment to the campus. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2018373&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
